Intro to Arduino Nano - Greg Reynolds

  This repository contains the documentation for a short course showing the need for switch debouncing
  when to input to processor is a real mechanical switch. Presentated at AY Jackson HS.
  
It is the rare electrical item that is any more complex than a hair dryer that doesn’t have a small microcontroller in it. 
(UPDATE: Dyson hair dryers have a microcontroller in them to drive their digital motor) Even an electric tooth bush, with its timer,
has a micro in it. So do stoves and refrigerators. Automobiles have probably over 20 micros embedded in components like the fuel injector,
speed controller, entertainment centre, tire pressure monitor, and so on. None of these items appear to be a computer since there is no
mouse, screen, or keyboard. The computer is embedded in the item.
